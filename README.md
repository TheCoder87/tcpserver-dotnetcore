# TCP Server on .NET Core
This sample project is a .NET Core's version of TCP listener application. To build the project, do the following (_provided you already have installed .NET Core_):

1. Restore the project. `dotnet restore`
2. Run the project right away. `dotnet run`

Once this gets up and running, enter the port where you want to publish it on, then consume it from any TCP client &mdash; `nc`, `telnet` and much more of clients are available for you to consume the services. This is a minimal project, a template, you can add features.
